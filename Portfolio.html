        <h1><strong> Me &amp; Taekwondo </strong>  </h1>
        <p><br> I began <abbr title="Taekwondo">Tkd</abbr> at the age four. I joined my local club in my hometown with my twin brother. It was my parents and brother who encouraged me to join. The moment I stepped into the club, I realized this was for me. I started training with the goals of just learning the game and its tactics, and it soon developed into a hobby. I remeber being extremely excited to begin my journey. </p>

        <p><br>In 2009, I joined my first national competition in Bahrain. I played under the weight category of -24Kgs. I Played a total of four matches, each match had a total of three one minute rounds and each round had a 30 seconds time off. I was extremely anxious, however I had a lot of faith in myself. I won a gold medal in the cadets category for girls under the weight of 29Kgs.</p></br>

        I had immensed faith in myself which made me push myelf throught it all. </br> </p>

        </figcaption><p><br> In 2015, I earned my first degree blackbelt and joined the Bahrain National Team. This was an enormous step in my athletic career. It was the first professional milestone I was working to. Although, this milestone came with pressure I was ready for it. The main national training goal was so to start working towards international competetions all around the world. </p>

        <p><br> By 2016, I started playing internationally. My first international competetion was held in Paris, France. We had to undergo intensive 
        training for 3 months while analyzing how Europeans played. We used different attacking, counter attacking and defensive styles to play. This competetion 
        will always have a speacial place in my heart becuase it was my first time playing internationally. Even though I did not achieve my the results I wished for, I was still proud of myself and my team for the 
        encouragement. </br> </p>
